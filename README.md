  Description
</h1>

<p>
  A bubble-hell 2D shooter.
</p>

<p>

<p>
  This was my first time using Unity and C#, and I made this for a college final project.
  It was fun.
</p>

<p>
  Anyways, I'm uploading the zip folder here just so I can save it in a cloud. 
  I don't see myself polishing this game in the near future, but I do have big plans with this kind of gameplay.
